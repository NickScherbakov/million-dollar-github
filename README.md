## 📚 Inspiration & Case Studies

### Caleb Porzio’s Million-Dollar Journey

> “5 years ago, I left my day job with no plan. 5 days later, I started working on an open source project called Livewire… Within 2 years I had made a GitHub sponsors account and ramped it up to \$100k/yr. Ever since I’ve been working on those same two projects and selling stuff along the way to fund my work on them.”

### The Importance of Quality & Persistence

> “All of this works because I spent years honing my craft and producing software that is truly useful. … You saw earlier how I worked full‑time on an open‑source project for almost an entire year before seeing any returns. The work people are sponsoring for has to be quality and remain the #1 priority.”

### Other Monetization Channels

“Monetization of your GitHub Repository, if done well, opens up doors: developers, companies, or clients will understand the value you provide and pay you for creating or managing projects.”
